Now we are working on getting our gentrification index. First, we want to calculate the percentage of low and high income people for census tracts in both years.

```{r}
#Getting population by Income numbers
bmore_ctmedhhinc12 <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract", 
  variables = c(tot = "B19001_001", 
                L = "B19001_002", L = "B19001_003", L = "B19001_004", L = "B19001_005", L = "B19001_006",

                H = "B19001_012", H = "B19001_013", H = "B19001_014", H = "B19001_015", H = "B19001_016", 
                H = "B19001_017"),
  state = "MD", 
  county = "Baltimore City",
  year = 2012,
  geometry = FALSE 
) %>%
  select(GEOID, variable, estimate) %>%
  rename(est12 = estimate, var12 = variable) %>%
  group_by(GEOID, var12) %>%

  ungroup() %>%
  summarize(H = sum(H), L = sum(L), tot = sum(tot)) %>%
  mutate(percentHighInc12 = H / tot,
         percentLowInc12 = L / tot) %>%
  mutate(GEOID = "24510280600")

#joining info back to 2012
bmore_ctmedhhinc12 <- bmore_ctmedhhinc12 %>%
  ungroup()%>%

#getting HH income for 2022
bmore_ctmedhhinc22 <- get_acs(

  variables = c(tot = "B19001_001", 
                L = "B19001_002", L = "B19001_003", L = "B19001_004", L = "B19001_005", L = "B19001_006",

  pivot_wider(names_from = var22, values_from = est22) %>%
  mutate(percentHighInc22 = H/tot, percentLowInc22 = L/tot)
```
Now that the data is ready getting it in my index

```{r}
#joining all
bmore_hhinc_change <- left_join(bmore_ctmedhhinc12, bmore_ctmedhhinc22, by = "GEOID") %>%
  select(GEOID, percentHighInc12, percentHighInc22, percentLowInc12, percentLowInc22)

#creating my final dataset
all.acs <- left_join(all.acs, bmore_hhinc_change)%>%
  mutate(ChangeInHighIncPct = (percentHighInc22 - percentHighInc12),
         ChangeInLowIncPct = (percentLowInc22 - percentLowInc12))

#getting my index
all.acs <- all.acs %>%
  mutate(
    NHHIncChangeper = HHIncChangeper / max(abs(HHIncChangeper), na.rm = TRUE),
    NChangeInHighIncPct = ChangeInHighIncPct / max(abs(ChangeInHighIncPct), na.rm = TRUE),
    NChangeInLowIncPct = ChangeInLowIncPct / max(abs(ChangeInLowIncPct), na.rm = TRUE)
  )%>%
  mutate(genindex = NChangeInHighIncPct - (NChangeInLowIncPct))%>%
  mutate(gentrify = case_when((genindex > (quantile(all.acs$genindex, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)))~ 1,
         TRUE ~ 0))
```
Now joining to Shape file

```{r}
baltimore_tracts <- tracts(state = "MD", county = "Baltimore City", year = 2022)
all.acs.sf <- left_join(baltimore_tracts, all.acs, by = "GEOID")

tm_shape(all.acs.sf)+
  tm_polygons(fill = "gentrify")
```
