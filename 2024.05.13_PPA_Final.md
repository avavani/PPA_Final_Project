# Abstract

Defining and predicting gentrification is becoming more and more relevant to the average person as neighborhood residents become more concerned about getting priced out of their communities. Once something that could only be observed in hindsight, anticipating gentrification and attempting to prevent its disparate effects has become the subject of activism and counter-lobbying efforts. This report attempts to determine if gentrification can be correctly identified in Baltimore City, Maryland based on neighborhood characteristics that the average person can observe.







# About Baltimore City

Baltimore City, Maryland sits on the Patapsco River and is home to over 585,000 people (2020 Census). An incredibly historic city, though Baltimore was once full of rigorous industry, unbridled American patriotism, and wealth, its late 20th century reality was plagued by extreme disinvestment, high crime, and white flight.

Baltimore is less than an hour North of Annapolis, MD (the state capital) and Washington, DC as the crow drives. Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI) does not lie within Baltimore City boundaries.

# Defining Gentrification

Gentrification has many different definitions and connotations. At least part of its definition is intangible: often one can simply "feel" when a neighborhood has gentrified. At a glance, the clues may be found in the presence of new construction trying especially hard to look older, or in the manifestation of high-priced coffee shops and their hipster patrons where there were none before. 

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development defines gentrification as, "a form of neighborhood change that occurs when high-income groups move to low-income areas, potentially altering the cultural and financial landscape of the original neighborhood”. 

Using this standard as a guide, we define our Gentrification Index per CT as follows:

<center> GI = (∆ High Income Proportion) + (Percent Change of Rent) + (Percent Change of Home Value) </center>

The change is calculated by subtracting the 2012 values from the 2022 values. The proportion of High Income residents per Census Tract is determined by tabulating the number of residents who make more than 80% of the AMI in Baltimore City alone during each given year. The change in Rent and Home Value were calculated based on median costs adjusted for inflation.

Once sorted in order of their Gentrification Index, we determine that the top 30th percentile of Census Tracts are extreme enough in their exhibition of the Index's ingredients to be labeled as "gentrified."

# Data Collection

For testing the ability to predict gentrification, input features that could be observed by eye were sourced, cleaned, and used in the model. Our data sources primarily included the 2012 and 2022 5-year ACS (American Community Survey) from the U.S. Census Bureau and Open Baltimore (<https://data.baltimorecity.gov/>).

The specific features pulled based on this criteria were:

_Baltimore City Open Bid List_
The Baltimore Bids feature includes city owned vacant lots and properties with vacant building notices. 

_Universities and Colleges_ 
The colleges feature includes the locations of universities and colleges in Baltimore. 

_Businesses_ 
The businesses feature contains the count of businesses in each community statistical area (CSA), which is a geographic measurement developed by the Baltimore City Planning Department to define neighborhood clusters. Ths model also includes a change in businesses feature, which accounts for the change in count of businesses per CSA from 2010 to 2019. 

_Vacant Lots_ 
The vacant lots feature includes the percentage of vacant lots per CSA. 

_Baltimore Schools_ 
The schools feature highlights the percentage of students per CSA who exceeded or met the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) math expectations. 

_Walk Score_
The walk score feature includes the average walk score by CSA and the change in walk score from 2017 to 2011.

The regression results reveal important insights into the factors influencing gentrification risk within the studied area. Among the predictors, MovedFromSameState17, IncPctChange, HUnitsPctChange, and OOSizePctChange stand out as statistically significant contributors to the likelihood of gentrification. These findings suggest that areas with an increase in housing units, owner-occupied household size, and income are more prone to gentrification pressures, which aligns with literature that has been conducted on the indicators of gentrification. Surprisingly, other features in the model do not demonstrate a significant relationship with gentrification risk, highlighting the nuanced nature of this phenomenon and limitations to predictive modeling.

The model's accuracy of 0.78 indicates that it correctly predicts gentrification status approximately 78% of the time, showcasing its potential utility in identifying at-risk neighborhoods. The sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) are reasonably balanced at 0.6154 and 0.8378, meaning the model is slightly better than chance at identifying true positives. 

Testing the outcomes.



Overall our model had accuracy of... and sensitivity of ....

This distinction between sensitivity and specificity is further illustrated by the probability distribution graph below. Here, we see that our model's predictions are concentrated around 0 for tracts with no gentrification. However, its predictions for tracts with gentrification are more spread out, signifying its lack of reliability in identifying true positives.

The higher peak to the left in the top chart indicates that the model is more confident in predicting non-gentrification instances (class 0) with lower probabilities (closer to 0). This suggests that there are clear features or patterns in the data that the model identifies as indicative of non-gentrification.

The more evenly distributed curve in the bottom chart suggests that the model's predicted probabilities for gentrification instances (class 1) are spread out across a wider range. The slight peak between 0.5 and 0.75 indicates that there are instances where the model predicts a moderate to high likelihood of gentrification, but with some variability.

Overall, these patterns highlight that the model has greater confidence identifying non-gentrification over gentrification.

# Conclusion

Measuring gentrification can be challenging, primarily due to the complexity of its definition. However, this model addresses this challenge by focusing on observable characteristics that the average resident can recognize. While advanced statistical models may have policy implications, the primary aim of this model is to empower city officials and residents to identify gentrification in their neighborhoods early on and take proactive steps to prevent displacement before it becomes a pressing issue.

The results of the model indicate…
